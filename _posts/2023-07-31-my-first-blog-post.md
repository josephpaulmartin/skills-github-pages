Hurricane Hector was a tropical cyclone that became the eighth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season. Originating north of South America on July 22, it entered the Pacific around July 25. It became a tropical depression on July 31 and a tropical storm about 12 hours later. It rapidly intensified to its initial peak as a Category 2 hurricane. It peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on August 6, with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a pressure of 936 mbar (27.64 inHg). It passed south of Hawaii's Big Island on August 8, causing high surf and necessitating the rescue of several dozen people on Oahu. It spent 186 hours at major hurricane intensity, the longest on record in the Eastern Pacific basin. It fell below that intensity on August 11. Deteriorating as it moved westward, it weakened to a tropical storm by August 13, a tropical depression by August 15, and dissipated the next day.
